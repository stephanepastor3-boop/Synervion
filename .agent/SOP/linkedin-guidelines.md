# Synervion LinkedIn Quality Guidelines

## Voice & Tone
- **Professional & Scientific**: We are a research-driven biotechnology brand.
- **Accessible**: Complex science must be explained simply, but not dumbed down.
- **Authentic**: Avoid "AI-sounding" fluff like "Unlock the power of...", "In today's world...", or "Game-changer".
- **No Hard Sell**: We educate first. The product is the solution, not the pitch.

## Formatting Rules
- **Hook**: First line must be a thumb-stopper. A surprising fact, a bold statement, or a question.
- **Structure**:
  - Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max).
  - Use whitespace generously.
  - Use bullet points for easy scanning.
- **Hashtags**: Use 3-5 relevant hashtags at the bottom. Do not clutter the text with them.
- **Call to Action (CTA)**: Soft CTA. "What's your experience with...?" or "Learn more at synervion.com".

## Forbidden
- 🚫 Emoji overload (Max 2 per post, if any).
- 🚫 Generic stock phrases ("Boost your health", "Take your life to the next level").
- 🚫 False medical claims. Stick to "Supports", "Promotes", "Aids in".

## Image Guidelines
- **Realistic**: No cartoonish or abstract AI art.
- **Clean**: High contrast, professional lighting.
- **Relevant**: Must directly relate to the topic (e.g. Cordyceps in a lab setting, or a runner in nature).
