# Synervion Automated Quality Assurance (QA) Checklist

The Automated Agent must verify **every single draft** against this checklist before sending it to the user. If any item is "FAIL", the Agent must iterate and rewrite.

## 1. Strategic Alignment Check
- [ ] **Niche Accuracy**: Does the post explicitly discuss Functional Mushrooms, Nutraceuticals, or Preventative Health? (Reject generic "Wellness" posts).
- [ ] **Brand Positioning**: Does it position Synervion as a research-driven, scientific authority? (Reject "Hustle Culture" or pure "Sales" tones).
- [ ] **Value First**: Does the post offer educational value *before* mentioning a product?

## 2. Tone & Verification (The "AI Turing Test")
- [ ] **No "AI-isms"**: Are the following banned words/phrases absent?
  - *“Unlock the power of...”*
  - *“In today’s fast-paced world...”*
  - *“Game-changer”*
  - *“Elevate your...”*
  - *“Dive deep into...”*
  - *“A tapestry of...”*
- [ ] **Scientific Nuance**: Does the post use precise language? (e.g., "Supports ATP production" instead of "Gives you crazy energy").
- [ ] **Human Sounding**: Does it read like a thought leader wrote it, or a marketing bot?

## 3. Structure & Formatting (Mobile First)
- [ ] **The Hook**: Is the first line under 140 characters and visually separated? Does it provoke curiosity or state a bold fact?
- [ ] **Whitespace**: are paragraphs restricted to 1-2 sentences maximum?
- [ ] **Scannability**: Are bullet points or numbered lists used for complex data?
- [ ] **Length**: Is the post between 150-300 words? (Long enough to be insightful, short enough to read).

## 4. Content Integrity
- [ ] **Fact-Check**: If a claim is made (e.g., "Cordyceps improves VO2 max"), is it plausible and aligned with general scientific consensus?
- [ ] **No False Promises**: Does the post avoid claiming to "Cure" or "Heal" specific diseases? (Must use regulatory-compliant language).

## 5. Visual Relevance
- [ ] **Concept Match**: Does the visual description described match the *core theme* of the text?
- [ ] **Aesthetic**: Is the requested style "Photorealistic, Macro/Cinematic, High Contrast"? (Reject "Illustration", "Cartoon", "Abstract").

## 6. Human Connection (The "Author" Check)
- [ ] **Personality**: Does the post feel like it was written by a *person* passionate about mycology, not a corporation?
- [ ] **Personal Cues**: Does it occasionally use phrases like "In our lab...", "I've noticed...", or "We believe..." to ground the voice?
- [ ] **Empathy**: Does it acknowledge the reader's journey (e.g., "We know how hard it is to stay consistent...")?
- [ ] **Unique Voice**: Is there a distinct "Synervion Flavor" (Scientific but Warm)?
