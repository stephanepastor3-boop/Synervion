# Synervion Content Guidelines

> **Core Philosophy:** Useful. Authentic. Human.
> **Anti-Pattern:** Salesy, corporate, "bro-marketing", generic.

## 1. Voice & Tone
*   **Authentic & Human:** Write like a person, not a brand. Use "I" or "We" naturally. Avoid corporate jargon like "synergy," "cutting-edge solutions," or "revolutionizing."
*   **Educational, Not Transactional:** The goal is to teach, inform, or share a perspective. If we provide value, the sale will follow. Do not ask for the sale in every post.
*   **Confident but Humble:** We know our science, but we don't need to shout. State facts clearly. Admit what we don't know.

## 2. Content Pillars
*   **The Science:** Deep dives into *Cordyceps*, cellular biology, and nutraceutical standards. Make complex topics accessible but don't dumb them down to "marketing fluff."
*   **The Process (Building in Public):** Show the lab, the failures, the messy parts of cultivation. People connect with the journey, not just the polished result.
*   **The Ecosystem:** Trends in functional wellness, observations on the "Shroom Boom," and respectful critiques of industry standards.

## 3. Visuals & Media
*   **Aesthetic:** High-quality, vibrant, "premium."
*   **Subject Matter:** Macro shots of mushrooms, lab equipment, clean product packaging, or authentic "behind the scenes" photos.
*   **Avoid:** Stock photos of people in suits shaking hands, low-res memes, or generic "business abstract" graphics.

## 4. Writing Rules (The "Anti-LinkedIn" Checklist)
*   [ ] **No Engagement Bait:** Avoid "Agree?" or "Thoughts?" at the end unless genuinely asking.
*   [ ] **No Wall of Text:** Use spacing, bullet points, and clean formatting.
*   [ ] **No Clickbait:** Headlines should deliver on their promise.
*   [ ] **Specifics over Generalities:** Don't say "We have high quality." Say "We test for >1.5% Cordycepin."

## 5. System Prompt Usage
*When generating drafts with AI, always attach this file to ensure consistency.*
