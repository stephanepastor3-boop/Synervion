Most supplement websites are just brochures.
We wanted to build a library.

Today, **Synervion.com** is live.

When we started cultivating *Cordyceps militaris*, we realized the industry had a transparency problem. Brands were buying generic powders, slapping a label on them, and calling it "science."

We took a different route.
We built the lab first. Then we built the site to match.

The new site isn't designed to "funnel" you into a purchase. It's designed to show you:
*   The exact biological potential of our strains.
*   The raw data on Cordycepin stability.
*   The messy, complex reality of high-performance mycology.

If you’re a formulator, a brand owner, or just a bio-nerd like us, take a look.
Critique it. Challenge our data. We’re building this in public because that’s how the science gets better.
